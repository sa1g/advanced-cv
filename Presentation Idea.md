- intro
	- we want an efficient and performing Clip that can run on edge devices i.e. smartphones
	- this presentation will be DENSE
	- say that they created a distilled clip model that is **faster** and more **training efficient**, by using an ensemble teacher and a reinforced dataset.
- Ensemble Teacher
	- mostly and intro to say which models
	- loss
- Reinforced Dataset
	- which dataset
	- synthetic captions
	- image augmentation
	- -> leads to the reinforced dataset
- model architecture
	- objective: reduce size and latency
	- text encoder (**text-repmixer**)
		- uses 1D convolutions and self-attention layers
		- spend some time to explain it
			- structural reparametrizatoin
			- convolutional token mixing
			- 
		- *detail in appendix F*
	- image encoder (**MCi**)
		- based on FastViT
		- *detail in appendix A*
- results
	- hardware requirements
	- latency
	- accuracy
	- benchmarks
- further improvements
	- PuMer
	- tiny vit
